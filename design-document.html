    <p class="parallax_description2"><b><u>Goal</u></b> - Educate children and middle-schoolers on the dangers regarding rising sea levels and storm surges through interactive simulations.<br>
		<br> <b><u>Rules and Regulations</u></b> - Users will get to choose up to 3 solutions in order to attempt and mitigate damage from the incoming natural disaster (which will largely affect the coast). The more damage they manage to mitigate, the higher their overall score will be in the game.<br>
    <br> <b><u>Genre</u></b>- Simulation, Role-Playing<br>
    <br><b><u>Summary</u></b> - Our touch-screen game will allow children to make choices on how to prepare for an impending natural disaster in order to minimize damage.
    <br><br>
    <b><u>Platform</u></b> - The platforms we will use for this project will be HTML/CSS/JavaScript (paired with Bootstrap) on the front-end, and Node.js on the back-end. <br> <br>
    <b><u>Version Control</u></b> - For version control, we will be using GitHub. <br>
    	<br><a href="https://www.lucidchart.com/invitations/accept/da0840e5-fbee-4bbf-ad3f-706feacee74b" target="_blank"><b>Project Implementation Plan</b></a> <br>
	    <br><a href="./wireframe2.0.png" target="_blank"><b>Wireframe Version 2.0</b></a>
	   
    <br><br>
	    <b><u>Game Concept</u></b> - 
	    Players choose which resources to invest in to attempt and mitigate damage from natural disasters around the coast. <br>
	    Levels are generated based on difficulty settings and have some premade structures that will be randomized. <br>
	    Players will be graded based on their ability to minimize the damage while maintaining the landscape and not drastically impacting the land. <br>
	    Players attempt to fend against mother nature by putting points into various solutions on the map through repeated tapping. <br>
	    The map will be largely focused on the coastal area, as that is the main area damaged by storm surges or hurricanes. <br>
	    Each tap will take a point out of their resources and potentially also lead to some other negative side effect, but in exchange will hopefully help the player defend their land. <br>
	    Levels will be generated randomly after the difficulty has been chosen, and might have different solutions or different preset points. <br>
	    Players will be graded on their ability to minimize damage while maintaining the landscape when the natural disaster hits. <br> <br>
	   

	    
		<br><u><b>Gameplay</b></u><br><br>
	    Each round will be around 3 minutes of total gameplay in length and will start as soon as the player hits the continue button on the “How to Play” screen. <br>
Players will be redirected to the main gameplay screen, which will have a map depicting the ocean (at the top of the screen) where the natural disaster will come from, the coast (in the middle of the screen) where players will attempt to prevent the hurricane from damaging, and the actual cities (at the bottom of the screen) which will contain more buildings and infrastructure that the players will try to defend. On the coast and on land, players will also have a multitude of solutions that they can allocate points towards (using the + / - buttons on the resource). If players hit the image of the solution itself, they will be shown a brief graphic on what the solution is and its impact on the surrounding environment. As solutions are built up, the background will dynamically change to match what the player is putting up as a solution. For example, if the player puts points into sandbags around the beach, the coast will slowly start having more and more sandbags on it. This way, the player can clearly see the impact that they have on the land that they are attempting to help.<br><br>
Players will have a timer in the top left showing how much time they have remaining to make their decisions. In addition to this, there will also be a button below the timer to fast-forwards into the end-game screen. Players will also have their remaining points in the top right corner, so that they know how many resources they have left to invest.<br>
Players can use their points to invest in certain solutions on the board in order to try and mitigate damage from the hurricane. Solutions will each have different effects depending on their real-life usages, and this will be our primary form of teaching the players what we want them to learn.<br><br>
Before starting the game, players will be able to choose from certain difficulty levels (which will correspond to easy, medium, and hard modes). Each mode will have a separate set of hurricanes (of which one will be randomly chosen) depending on the category of the hurricane as well as how hard it hits the coast. Players will also be given fewer points to work with on harder difficulties.<br><br>
Each run will have randomized pre-existing structures that cannot be removed - these will be shown as points already allocated to the solutions, and will not take away from the player’s set number of starting points. <br><br>
At the end of the alloted time (or after the player skips the remaining time), primary information regarding how the player did will be shown alongside a small image. Players will be able to see the impact that they had on the community and the future of the area. Afterwards, they will then be redirected to a scoring screen that will put up their statistics on the amount of land they saved, the effect it had on tourism, etc. Lastly, the player can input their initials and be placed on the local leaderboard.<br><br>

	    <b><u>Background</u></b><br>As the temperature rise globally, sea levels are also rising. High sea levels can cause more intense tropical storms, such as hurricanes, which means that the impact of future tropical storms are more dangerous and cause more damage to the coast line. As a result, ecosystems are destroyed along the coast and wildlife are becoming endangered.  <br>
		Hurricanes, synonyms with Tropical Cyclones, are rapidly rotating storm systems with a low-pressure center, strong winds, and heavy rain. In North Carolina, hurricanes are a common problem that begins from June till the end of November. With the rise of sea levels, the impact of hurricanes on the North Carolinian Coast also increases, and more recently, this has become a life-threatening issue. There are many different ways to mitigate the dangerous impact of rising sea levels on the coastline. The first step is to live green. Reducing your carbon footprint can help with rising levels of global temperature, thus hindering the rise of sea levels. However, cities and towns on the coastline have different engineering methods that can also assist with mitigating damage to the coast. Common methods are by installing sandbags, break water tubes, seawalls, planting beach grass, salt marshes, oyster reefs, and many more. The purpose of this game is to spread knowledge of the dangers of rising sea levels, and educate the masses of preventive ways to avoid impact from the damages that might occur.
<br><br><br>
		<b><u>Solutions</u></b><br>
  <br><u><b>Natural</b></u><br>
<b>- Salt Marshes</b><br>
Salt Marshes protect coastline from erosion by buffering wave action and trapping sediments. They reduce flooding by slowing and absorbing rainwater and protect water quality by filtering runoff, and by metabolizing excess nutrients.<br>
<b>- Oyster Reefs</b><br>
Densely packed beds and reefs of oysters form a natural breakwater, dramatically cutting wave heights. They can also occur naturally in intertidal areas where they provide a form of shoreline armoring, preventing erosion and protecting marshes.<br>
<b>- Mangroves</b><br>
During these extreme events mangroves play multiple roles. They may reduce the height of the storm surge, they reduce the wind waves that top the storm surge, they reduce wind speed across the water surface, which can prevent waves re-forming, and they can even provide some mechanisms for trapping debris, which is a major cause of death and injury during storms.<br>
<b>- Seagrasses</b>
Seagrasses help erosion by stabilizing sediment in the ocean. Seagrasses also create a shoal-like effect and slow down the movement of ocean currents between the seabed and tips of seagrasses.<br>
<b>- Dunes</b><br>
Sand dunes serve an important purpose by protecting inland areas from coastal water intrusion. They are able to absorb the impact and protect inland areas from high energy storms and act as a resilient barrier to the destructive forces of wind and waves.<br>
<b>- Barrier Islands</b><br>
Barrier islands are long, relatively narrow islands that run along a coast parallel to the mainland. They are built up by the action of waves and currents and help protect the coastline from erosion by surf and tidal surges by taking the hits first and breaking up the waves.<br><br>
<u><b>Infrastructure</b></u><br>
<b>- Sea walls</b><br>
Seawalls are hard engineered structures with a primary function to prevent further erosion of the shoreline, with a secondary function of coastal flood defences.<br>
<b>- Flood Gates</b><br>
Adjustable gates used to control water flow, and can redirect water flow into a flow bypass or detention basin under threat of a flood.<br><br>

 <b><u>Role</u></b><br> 
  You play as the mayor of a coastal town who has to defend the city using various tools at their disposable to reduce the impact of the hurricane. Using a limited number of resources, try to plan what solutions would be the most effective method of reducing damage while still keeping the city aesthetically clean.<br> <br> 
  
  <b><u>Difficulty Settings</u></b><br> 
  Hurricanes are categorized on a level scale from one to five which is determined by the wind speed of each specific hurricane. This level gives a general idea of what one can expect from the hurricane thus we chose our difficulty selection to be based off these hurricane levels in addition to the path and destruction of the hurricane. Our difficulty selection will have three different difficulties which in total will encompass all the levels from one to five while also taking into consideration the path and destruction of the hurricane:<br><br>
		<b>Level one (indirect) to two (indirect):</b> “Mighty Storm”<br>
<b>Level two (direct) to four (indirect):</b> “Wild Typhoon”<br>
<b>Level four (direct) to five (direct):</b> “Fearsome Cyclone”<br></p> 
<br>
<p class="parallax_description2">	
 <br>Each difficulty setting will have a subset of real life hurricanes that fit in the category of the level. The added note of “indirect” versus “direct” specifies the path the hurricane took which can directly influence the damage it has done. For example, a level four indirect hurricane could miss its target thus dealing significantly less damage then a level four direct hurricane which when straight over its target. When the player selects one of the difficulties, they will be randomly assigned one of the predetermined subsets of hurricanes under the specified hurricane difficulty.
